School Fight is a turn based fighting game. Choose your party and battle it out in 3vs3 fights to become king of school!
There are three types of characters: strength, intelligence and assholiness. The mechanics work by a rock paper scissors principle: 
strength is effective against intelligence, intelligence is effective against assholiness and assholiness is effective against strength
All characters (including the opponent party) attack at the same time. This gives the fights a unique dynamic.
Use items to deal damage or repleanish your health. Beat all nine levels including two mini games and a boss battle.

The game is written in Javascript/jQuery using mainly regular HTML and CSS for displaying graphics.
